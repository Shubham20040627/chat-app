# How to Get a Free Domain Name

The short answer: **It is very hard to get a "real" domain (like .com) for free, but you have options.**

## Option 1: The Best "Almost Real" Domain (Reliable)
You already have a free subdomain from Render:
*   `https://shubham-chat.onrender.com`
*   **Pros:** 100% Free, SSL (HTTPS) included, reliable.
*   **Cons:** It ends in `.onrender.com`.

## Option 2: GitHub Student Developer Pack (Best for Students)
If you are a student with a school email (`.edu` or ID card), this is the **Golden Ticket**.
1.  Go to [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
2.  Sign up.
3.  **You get 1 FREE year of a real domain** (like `.me`, `.tech`, or `.live`) from partners like Namecheap.

## Option 3: JS.ORG (For JavaScript Projects)
If your project is open source (it is!), you can request a `js.org` subdomain.
*   Example: `shubham-chat.js.org`.
*   **How:** You have to submit a Pull Request to their GitHub repo. It looks very professional for JS developers.

## Option 4: "Freenom" (.tk, .ml, .ga) - ⚠️ AVOID
Years ago, you could get `.tk` domains for free.
*   **Current Status:** They are broken/offline due to legal issues.
*   **Verdict:** Do not try to use them. They will likely be taken away from you.

## Recommendation
If you are not a student, **stick with the Render subdomain**. It is fast, secure, and Google still indexes it.
