# How to Sell Your App Source Code

Yes, you can absolutely sell this! Developers often buy "starter kits" to save time.

## Where to Sell
1.  **CodeCanyon (Envato Market)** - *Best Option*
    *   This is the biggest marketplace for code.
    *   You list your app as "Real-time Chat App with React & Node.js".
    *   Price it around **$15 - $25**.
    *   People buy it, download the zip file, and use it for their own projects.

2.  **Gumroad**
    *   Very easy to set up.
    *   You keep more of the profit (CodeCanyon takes a big cut).
    *   BUT, you have to find your own customers (CodeCanyon brings customers to you).

3.  **Flippa**
    *   This is for selling *established* websites with traffic.
    *   Only use this if your deployed site gets thousands of visitors.

## How to Prepare for Sale
Refine your project to make it "product-ready":
1.  **Clean Code:** Remove any console logs or unused files.
2.  **Documentation:** Write a PDF guide on "How to Install". (We already have `DEPLOYMENT.md`!)
3.  **Screenshots:** Take beautiful screenshots of the chat interface.
4.  **Zip It:** Create a clean zip file of the source code (excluding `node_modules`).

## Is it worth it?
*   If your design is unique and the code is clean, you can make a few hundred dollars a month passively.
*   "Chat Apps" are a popular search term!
